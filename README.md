# An example Vue Drizzle token crowdsale dApp

## Smart contracts

- TestToken
- TestCrowdsale

## Dependencies

- Vue
- Drizzle & Drizzle Vue Plugin
- Vuex
- Vue Router
- Vue Bootstrap
- Vue Toasted

## TODO

Minimum viable version is completed, but there's a lot of other work to polish the dApp (the Vue part especially):

- Show how many tokens the person gets when they enter the ETH amount
- Show Crowdsale contract ETH balance
- Show how much ETH until the cap is reached
- Write Solidity sanity tests
- etc.
